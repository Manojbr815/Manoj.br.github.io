Environmental awareness and curiosity building workshop for rural school kids. 

Building awareness
======
I assisted my professor in environmental teaching to rural school kids of Doddaballapura, Karnataka.
It was a workshop to sensitize the school kids about primary elements of nature, assessment of different parameters of the atmosphere/airâ€”the causes for these parameters to fe in an environment and so on.

Environmental games
======
We conducted some environmental games. An indigenous game named "Tipping Point", basically has major characters that are present in any ecosystem. The predators, prey, plants, human settlements/infrastructures and other environmental factors. 
We made the kids balance all these characters on a disc [ecosystem]. The kids learnt about the importance of balancing an ecosystem with the inclusion of all living diversity.
