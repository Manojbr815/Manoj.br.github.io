This is a description of a teaching experience. You can use markdown like any other post.

Building awareness
======
I had an opportunity to assist my professor in an environmental teaching to rural school kids of Doddaballapura, Karnataka.
It was a workshop to sensitize the school kids about primary elemets of nature, assesment of different parameters of the atmosphere/air. The causes for these parameters to fluctuate in an environment and so on.

Environmental games
======
We conducted some environmental games. An indegnous game named "Tipping point", which basically has major characters that are present in any ecosystem. The predators, preys, plants, humans and other environmental factors. 
We made the kids balance all these characters on a disc [ecosystem]. The kids learnt about the importance of balancing an ecosystem with the inclusion of all living diversity.
